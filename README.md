# AlMartsonUnityHandyToolsCompilation
My own custom made set of Unity3D Handy Tools: Multiple Components Copy between two GameObjects, Components deletion, GameObject Transform (position + rotation + scale) Replacement and Components Replacement &amp; Baking Emissive Materials into Lightmaps (Taken from: https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/214718843-My-Emissive-material-shader-does-not-appear-in-the-Lightmap- ). Some of these tools belong to several authors (although I changed them a little to make them more usable for my case), credited at the begining of each Script in the &lt;summary> comment.
