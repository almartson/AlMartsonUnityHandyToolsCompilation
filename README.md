# AlMartsonUnityHandyToolsCompilation
My own custom made set of Unity3D Handy Tools: 

In the Unity Editor, in the TAB named 'GamObjects and Components' you will have:
* Multiple Components Copy between two GameObjects.
* Components deletion
* GameObject Replace (by another GO in Scene or a Prefab): Transform (position + rotation + scale) and Components.

In the Unity Editor, in the TAB named 'MyCustomBake/Bake All Objects Including Emission (GameObjects) Light Into Lightmaps' you will have the option to:
* Bake Emissive Materials into Lightmaps (Note: The GOs must be marked as Static, and have a particular Layer or a Tag, as decribed in the Tool). The Heart of the Source Code of this handy algorithm was taken from: https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/214718843-My-Emissive-material-shader-does-not-appear-in-the-Lightmap- ).

Some of these tools belong to several authors (although I changed them a little to make them more usable for my case), credited at the begining of each Script in the 'summary' comment.

Thanks to this and other Free Tools I was able to finish some interesting Projects.. I am very grateful, so I decided to share it with you.

It was tested in Unity 2017.1 & 2018.4.0f1.

Have a nice day.
